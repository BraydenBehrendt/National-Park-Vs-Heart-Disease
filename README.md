This interactive web map visualizes the relationship between heart disease mortality rates and the locations of U.S. National Parks. The choropleth layer uses varying shades of red to represent heart disease mortality rates, with darker shades indicating higher rates. National Parks are marked with custom tree icons from Font Awesome, which users can click to display the names of each park. The aim is to explore potential correlations between access to natural spaces and heart disease rates, raising awareness about public health and environmental factors. While the map doesnâ€™t imply causation, it encourages further reflection on how access to green spaces like National Parks might influence health outcomes. This tool offers a visual platform to consider the broader implications of public health, environment, and outdoor recreation.
